# Project documentation snapshot — 15-10-2025

This document summarizes work performed on 15 October 2025: security hardening and cleanup in the backend of the project `nwrcontractregistry`.

## Summary of code changes

1. backend/config/db.php
   - Validates required environment variables (DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_NAME).
   - Uses utf8mb4 in DSN.
   - Sets safer PDO options: ERRMODE_EXCEPTION, DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE => ASSOC, EMULATE_PREPARES => false.
   - Logs detailed errors to `backend/logs/db_error.log` and returns a generic JSON error to clients.

2. backend/send_contract_reminders.php
   - Replaced hardcoded SMTP credentials with env-based configuration (SMTP_HOST, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_SECURE).
   - If SMTP credentials are missing, the script logs the issue and skips sending emails to avoid secret leakage.

3. backend/models/Contract.php
   - Robust handling of SMTP env vars with sensible fallbacks.
   - Safer logging of mailer errors (log messages without exposing secrets).

4. README.md
   - Added a `".env variables"` section documenting required environment variables for DB and SMTP.

## Verification performed

- PHP syntax checks run on modified PHP files:
  - `php -l backend/config/db.php` — no syntax errors
  - `php -l backend/send_contract_reminders.php` — no syntax errors
  - `php -l backend/models/Contract.php` — no syntax errors

- Grep/search for hardcoded credentials revealed an existing `.env` file in the repo containing SMTP credentials. Action recommended below.

## Immediate actions required (high priority)

1. Remove secrets from repository
   - If `.env` or other files with secrets have been committed, remove them from the repository and add `.env` to `.gitignore`.
   - Rotate any leaked credentials (SMTP app password, DB users, etc.) immediately.

2. Protect logs
   - Ensure `backend/logs/` is not web-accessible and has restricted file permissions.
   - Add log rotation and retention policy.

## Recommended follow-ups (medium priority)

- Centralize configuration into `backend/config/config.php` and validate env values in one place.
- Add unit tests for mailer and DB connection logic to prevent regressions.
- Add a pre-commit hook or CI check to detect committed secrets.
- Add documentation for setting up `.env` on development and production environments.

## Files created/edited in this session

- Edited:
  - `backend/config/db.php`
  - `backend/send_contract_reminders.php`
  - `backend/models/Contract.php`
  - `README.md`

- Created:
  - `doc/readme-15-10-2025.md` (this file)

## Notes

- I did not remove the `.env` file for you because that contains real credentials and should be rotated if deleted; let me know if you want me to remove it from the repo (I can also add a step to create a safe `.env.example` file instead).

---

If you'd like, I can now:
- Remove `.env` and add `.env` to `.gitignore` and optionally create `.env.example`.
- Centralize config in a single file.
- Add a simple test harness to validate DB and SMTP configuration.

Tell me which one to do next.

# File Upload Limit Implementation - 5MB

## Overview
Successfully implemented a 5MB file upload limit for the NWR Contract Registry system with both client-side and server-side validation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server-Side Implementation (backend/index.php)
- **Added `formatBytes()` helper function** - Converts bytes to human-readable format (B, KB, MB, GB)
- **Enhanced `handleFileUpload()` function** with comprehensive validation:
  - File size limit: 5MB (5,242,880 bytes)
  - Allowed file types: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, XLSX, XLS
  - Proper error handling for all upload scenarios
  - Detailed error messages with actual file sizes

### 2. Client-Side Implementation (frontend/)
- **Updated HTML forms** (`manage_contract.html`):
  - Added file size information for users
  - Updated `accept` attributes to include all allowed file types
  - Added error message containers
  
- **JavaScript validation** (`manage_contract.js`):
  - `validateFileSize()` function for immediate feedback
  - File size validation (5MB limit)
  - File type validation
  - Clear error messages
  - Automatic input clearing for invalid files

- **CSS styling** (`manage_contract.css`):
  - Error message styling (red background)
  - Success message styling (green background)  
  - File information styling

### 3. Security Enhancements
- **Root .htaccess** - PHP upload limits and security headers
- **Uploads .htaccess** - Prevents script execution in uploads directory
- **File type restrictions** - Only allows safe document types

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- **`test_file_upload_page.html`** - Interactive testing interface
- **`test_upload_endpoint.php`** - Server-side validation testing
- **`check_php_config.php`** - PHP configuration verification

## Configuration Requirements

### PHP Configuration (php.ini)
The system requires these minimum PHP settings:
```ini
upload_max_filesize = 5M
post_max_size = 6M
max_execution_time = 300
max_input_time = 300
file_uploads = On
```

### XAMPP Users
1. Edit `C:\xampp\php\php.ini`
2. Find and update the above settings
3. Restart Apache server
4. Verify with: `http://localhost/nwrcontractregistry/backend/tests/check_php_config.php`

## Testing

### Automated Testing
Run the configuration check:
```
http://localhost/nwrcontractregistry/backend/tests/check_php_config.php
```

### Manual Testing
Use the interactive test page:
```
http://localhost/nwrcontractregistry/backend/tests/test_file_upload_page.html
```

### Test Scenarios
1. **File Size Tests**:
   - Upload file < 5MB → Should succeed
   - Upload file = 5MB → Should succeed  
   - Upload file > 5MB → Should fail with size error

2. **File Type Tests**:
   - Upload .pdf, .doc, .docx, .txt, .xlsx, .xls → Should succeed
   - Upload .jpg, .png, .exe, etc. → Should fail with type error

3. **Error Handling Tests**:
   - No file selected → Should handle gracefully
   - Network interruption → Should show appropriate error
   - Server limits exceeded → Should show clear message

## Integration

The file upload limit is fully integrated with the existing system:
- **Contract creation** and **editing** forms include validation
- **Database records** are updated with file paths
- **Email notifications** continue to work unchanged
- **User authentication** and **role management** unchanged
- **Existing uploaded files** remain accessible

## Error Messages

### Client-Side Messages
- "File size (X.XX MB) exceeds the maximum limit of 5MB."
- "File type 'XXX' is not allowed. Allowed types: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, XLSX, XLS"

### Server-Side Messages  
- "File is too large. Maximum size allowed is 5MB."
- "File type not allowed. Allowed types: pdf, doc, docx, txt, xlsx, xls"
- "File upload was interrupted."
- "Failed to move uploaded file to destination."

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome/Edge/Firefox (modern versions)
- ✅ File API support for client-side validation
- ✅ FormData support for AJAX uploads
- ✅ Progressive enhancement (works without JavaScript)

## Maintenance Notes
- **Log files**: Upload errors are logged through existing error handling
- **File cleanup**: Uploaded files follow existing naming convention
- **Database**: File paths stored in contracts table as before
- **Backup**: Include uploads directory in regular backups

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. **Progress indicators** for large file uploads
2. **Drag-and-drop** file upload interface
3. **Multiple file selection** for batch uploads
4. **File preview** functionality
5. **Automatic file compression** for PDFs
6. **Virus scanning** integration
